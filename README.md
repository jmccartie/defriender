# Description

The problem: "My Facebook news feed is too cluttered. I just wish I could label everyone an 'Acquaintance' and then add friends one-by-one."

The solution: Defriender.

# How It Works

1. Authenticate in the app via Facebook
2. Click button
3. All your friends will be moved into the "Acquaintances" list

# TODO

* I built everything in theory (routes work, etc.), but haven't actually tried it out.
* Tests!!
